# FilesPrinter
 small app to print all files in a folder periodically;
 redid this app and the way it works 3 times over;
 still have old methods to convert docx to pdf
 using docx4j; don't know if we need that now.
 partially functional.
 
 #TODO
 
 #CLEAN THE CODE
 #add configuration file? with preferred print directory and printing settings
 #treat errors and other stuff that will inevitably go wrong
 #try and make this app similar to a service?
 #msExcel will not quit without 3 seconds timeout,
 #msWord and msExcel will not always quit.
