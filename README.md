# FilesPrinter

 small app to print all files in a folder periodically;<br>
 redid this app and the way it works 3 times over;<br>
 still have old methods to convert docx to pdf<br>
 using docx4j; don't know if we need that now.<br>
 partially functional.<br>
 
 #TODO
 
 #CLEAN THE CODE <br>
 #add configuration file? with preferred print directory and printing settings <br>
 #treat errors and other stuff that will inevitably go wrong <br>
 #try and make this app similar to a service? <br>
 #msExcel will not quit without 3 seconds timeout, <br>
 #msWord and msExcel will not always quit. <br>
 
 <strike>#make logging of every print job with file and timestamp</strike> <br>
	#DONE (cannot verify if print was successful for now) <br>
 <strike>#archive printed files</strike><br>
	#DONE<br>
 <strike>#make logging and archives by date</strike><br>
	#DONE<br>


 Mostly spaghetti code
 No longer working on this, kept for posterity
