# FilesPrinter
 small app to print all files in a folder periodically;
 redid this app and the way it works 3 times over;
 still have old methods to convert docx to pdf
 using docx4j; don't know if we need that now.
 patially functional app thingy.
 
 #TODO
 
 #add config file? with preferred print directory and printing settings
 #make logging of every print job with file and timestamp
 #archive printed files
 #make logging and archives by date
 #treat errors and other stuff that will inevitably go wrong
 #try and make this app similar to a service?
